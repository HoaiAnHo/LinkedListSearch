# LinkedListSearch
Demonstration of ability to create data structures, manipulate user input, and output to console

## Program Summary
When the program starts up, it will prompt the user to input a sentence (free-running and
assumed to be about 100 characters long). After the user inputs the sentence, all the
words in it will be placed into separate nodes and linked up in a linked list. After that,
menu options will be given to the user, and will continue to be given until the user enters
the ‘E’ exit option, which will free up the linked list of words and exit the program. The
other menu options include ‘S’ and ‘I’, which both search for any preexisting words in the
list and output them, but do so by case-sensitive or case-insensitive approach,
respectively. The ‘A’ option adds new word entries by prompting the user to input a
sentence again, but will add the new words to the already existing linked list. And the ‘D’
option deletes the current linked list while freeing the allocated space.
